DESCRIPTION:
This is a stylized page visualizing 3 aspects of a sorting algorithm:
1) Shuffling 20 stacks 
	a. ranging from 24px in height to 500px
	b. shuffles are logged to the console
2) Quick sorting the stacks from shortest to tallest 
	a. instantly with no visualization
	b. sorts are logged to the console
3) Visualizing the individual steps of sorting the stacks
	a. continue clicking to make each step in the sorter
	b. colors change according to what which stack is being swapped
	c. swaps are logged to the console
	
SOURCES:
The shuffle sorting button uses the Fisher-Yates Shuffle
The quick sorting button uses the Insertion Sort Algorithm
The step by step sorting button visualizes the Bubble Sort Algorithm
